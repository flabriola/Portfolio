This repository showcases projects I have worked on that don't have public repositories. Projects include university coursework, personal projects, and freelance work spanning various technologies and disciplines.


## âœ¨ Projects

### Found DXB | Freelance
*[Project description coming soon]*


## ðŸ“š Academic Projects (/Academic)

A collection of university coursework including codebases, research papers, presentations, and reports from developed applications. 
*You can explore all related documents, reports, and source code for these projects in the `/Academic` directory.*

### HomeSpace | Software Engineering - Y3 
**Group Project** spanning both semesters of year 3, covering all aspects of software engineering team development and delivery of a web and mobile application for smart home device control.

My major contributions: initializing software documentation, defining scope (stakeholders and their 'stake' in the application) and software requirements, leading branding (logo, color scheme, and style) and prototype development in Figma and programming.

**Tech Stack:** React.js with Tailwind CSS for the frontend, Firebase (Auth + Firestore) for backend and database, and a Node.js/Express service for custom 2FA, all managed with Scrum, GitHub, and Jira for development.

### Designing a Software-Based System | Introduction to Software Engineering - Y2
Coursework focused on writing comprehensive documentation for a software-based system, including Assumptions & Expectations, Functional & Non-functional requirements, UML diagrams, Use Cases, Traceability Matrix, and other software documentation diagrams.

### User Centered Design | User Centered Experimental Design - Y2
**Group Project** involving mobile app prototype creation, testing, data collection and processing in R, report writing and presentation of findings.

**Tech Stack:** JustInMind, R. Contributed with prototype (own repo https://github.com/flabriola/UFit), data collection and processing in R and part of report.

### Re-designing a Real-world Poorly Designed Website | Web Design and Database - Y1
**Group project** redesigning a poorly designed website as part of Web Design and Database course. Contributed to project organization, team coordination, website redesign (Figma), report writing and initial codebase implementation (HTML5, IA, layout, structure).

**Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, Figma.
