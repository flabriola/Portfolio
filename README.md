# Portfolio

This Repository is intended to showcase some projects I have worked on that either do not have public repositories. Projects include university coursework, personal projects and freelance work. They span across a range of technologies and disciplines.

## Projects

### Found DXB

### Academic

This directory includes my university coursework that I consider worth mentioning. Some include codebases whilst others are research papers and presentations, as well as reports from developed applications.

#### HomeSpace | Software Engineering - Y3
Group Project. This project spanned across both semesters of year 3. It included all aspects of a software engineering team for the development and delivery of a web and mobile application that controlled smart home devices. From documentation, to testing, to agile development to implementation.

My major contributions lied in: initializing software documentation, by defining the scope (stakeholders, and their 'stake' in the application) and software requirements, leading branding (logo, color scheme, and style) and prototype development in Figma and programming.

**Tech Stack:** React.js with Tailwind CSS for the frontend, Firebase (Auth + Firestore) for backend and database, and a Node.js/Express service for custom 2FA, all managed with Scrum, GitHub, and Jira for development.

#### Reflections on a Safety Critical System Incident | Introduction to Software Engineering - Y2
Presentation exploring the failures and lessons learned on the software engineering aspects of the NATS Major Incident.

#### Designing a Software-Based System | Introduction to Software Engineering - Y2
Coursework based on writing documentation for a software-based system. Including Assumptions & Expectations, Functional & Non-functional requirements, UML diagrams, Use Cases, Traceability Matrix, and other diagrams and software documentation.

#### Master Mind | Hardware-Software Interface - Y2
Mastermind game for Raspberry Pi 2/3 using C and ARM Assembly.

#### Image Processing | Hardware-Software Interface - Y2
F28HS Coursework. Image processing in C.

#### User Centered Design | User Centered Experimental Design - Y2
Group Project, included creating a prototype of a mobile app, testing, collecting data and processing it in R, writing a report and presenting the findings.

**Tech Stack:** JustInMind, R. Contributed with prototype (own repo https://github.com/flabriola/UFit), data collection and processing in R and part of report.

#### Re-designing a Real-world Poorly Designed Website | Web Design and Database - Y1
Group project. Redesign of a poorly designed website as part of my Web Design and Database course. Contributed to the organization of the project and team members, redesign (Figma) of the website, report writing and initial implementation of the code base (HTML5, IA, layout, structure).

**Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, Figma.

#### Exploring the use and effects of Big Data in Businesses | Praxis - Y1
Research Paper as part of my Praxis course.
