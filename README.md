## ✨ Projects

### Found DXB | Freelance
*[Project description coming soon]*


## ✨ Academic Projects (/Academic)

A collection of university coursework including codebases, research papers, presentations, and reports from developed applications. 
*You can explore all related documents, reports, and source code for these projects in the `/Academic` directory.*

### HomeSpace | Software Engineering - Y3 
**Group Project** spanning both semesters of year 3, covering all aspects of software engineering team development and delivery of a web and mobile application for smart home device control.
My major contributions: initializing software documentation, defining scope (stakeholders and their 'stake' in the application) and software requirements, leading branding (logo, color scheme, and style) and prototype development in Figma and programming.
**Tech Stack:** React.js with Tailwind CSS for the frontend, Firebase (Auth + Firestore) for backend and database, and a Node.js/Express service for custom 2FA, all managed with Scrum, GitHub, and Jira for development.

### Designing a Software-Based System | Introduction to Software Engineering - Y2
Coursework focused on writing comprehensive documentation for a software-based system, including Assumptions & Expectations, Functional & Non-functional requirements, UML diagrams, Use Cases, Traceability Matrix, and other software documentation diagrams.

### User Centered Design | User Centered Experimental Design - Y2
